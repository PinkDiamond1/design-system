# Table

Tables present tabular data in a grid which allows users to visually scan and understand associations between the values.

## Example

<component-preview path="components/table/sample.html" height="250px" width="800px"> </component-preview>

## How to Use This

*	Use a table when users need to compare information in rows and columns

## Don't Use This For

* Laying out the visual content of a webpage.

## Design Protocol
* Use the <caption> tag to describe the contents of the table similar to a heading. Captions help users find, navigate, and understand tables.
