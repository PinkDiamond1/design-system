## Accessibility

The B.C. government is committed to creating websites, online content, and applications that are accessible to all British Columbians, regardless of their level of ability. 

We are working toward meeting international web accessibility from the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and are committed to designing, developing, and updating websites to meet or exceed this standard.

Design system components are built to meet or exceed the WCAG AA 2.0 standard. You can find guides and step-by-step instructions on how to develop accessible content and websites on the [Accessibility and Inclusion Toolkit](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5D5C4759BC7E494AB9E8EDB7AD3D3D78).
